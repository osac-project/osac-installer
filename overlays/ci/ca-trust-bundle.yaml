# Trust Bundle - Automatically sync CA certificate to ca-bundle ConfigMaps
#
# This Bundle resource uses trust-manager to automatically sync the CA certificate
# from the default-ca secret in cert-manager namespace to the ca-bundle ConfigMap
# in all application namespaces. Trust-manager watches for changes to the CA and
# updates all ConfigMaps automatically.
